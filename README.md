# Learning C 

## Reasons

1. According to George Hotz doing CRUD web applications it's translating and not programming. Whilst the general idea is not really true, as there a lot of programming concepts that are necessary when programming a CRUD web applications. Some of those are:
    
    a. Clean coding

    b. Software architecture

    c. Systems design

    d. Networking

    e. Software Security

    Granted, not everyone who develops CRUD web applications, specially majority of bootcamp graduates, are applying or have great knowledge of the principles above.
    Nevertheless, CRUD web applications do not present a great level of complexity and do not represent the essence of programming.

2. In order to understand advanced concepts, like Operating Systems, Hardware Emulators, Compilers, Virtual Machines, in order to deepen the understanding of how computers work and program them elegantly, we need to master C programming. 

## Learning Path

1. Understanding most important C concepts (from an experienced programmer level, not talking about basics of programming here):

    a. Dynamic memory allocation

    b. Pointers

    c. Function pointers

    d. Recursion

    e. Typecasting and Typedef in C

    f. Union vs Struct

2. Path

    a. Hacker Rank

    b. RISC-V CPU emulator
